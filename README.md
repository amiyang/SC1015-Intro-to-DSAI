# SC1015 Mini-Project
For our mini project in this module, we performed analysis on the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition and Performance [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) from Kaggle. We aimed to find the main reasons for an employee's resignation in IBM and make recommendations to improve the attrition rate of the company.
